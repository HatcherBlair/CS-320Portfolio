# How can I ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is functional and secure I use a variety of testing methods. When testing my solutions I make sure to remain outcome nuetral and test all use cases.  I also ensure security by running a dependency check to ensure that all of the libraries I am using are secure and do not have known exploits.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorperate them into a program?
When interpreting user needs I make sure that I ask the users as many questions as possible.  I make sure that I stay solution nuetral, meanning that even if a user is telling me the solution they want to see, I do not write that down.  I write down why they want that solution and make sure that I understand the problem that needs to be solved.  This prevents you from limiting the possible solutions to the problem and look at the issue at hand without ruling anything out.

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software I first define the goals for the software.  Then I look for competitors and see if anyone else is already doing the same thing that I want to do.  If they are, I take notes.  If not, I look and see if there is a demand for this product, if there is no demand then it might not be worth implementing.  Once I have the goals clearly laid out, I start to work on the functionality of the project.  Once the basic functionality is in place, I begin to work on the UI and design for the software, I find that it is much easier to create a design when you know the types of data that you are going to be working with and already have infastructure to test the design.
